    <h2 class="sub-heading">Breakfast: Caramel Pecan Monkey Bread</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <input type="checkbox">1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast <br>
    <input type="checkbox">4 cup warm water (110° to 115°) <br>
    <input type="checkbox">5 tablespoons plus 1/2 cup butter, divided <br>
    <input type="checkbox">1-1/4 cups warm 2% milk (110° to 115°) <br>
    <input type="checkbox">2 large eggs, room temperature <br>
    <input type="checkbox">1-1/4 cups sugar, divided <br>
    <input type="checkbox">1 teaspoon salt <br>
    <input type="checkbox">5 cups all-purpose flour <br>
    <input type="checkbox">1 teaspoon ground cinnamon <br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast in warm water. Melt 5 tablespoons butter. Add to yeast mixture along with milk and eggs; stir
            in 1/4 cup sugar, salt and 3 cups flour. Beat on medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in enough remaining flour
            to form a firm dough.</li>
        <li>Turn out onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 6-8 minutes. Place in a greased bowl,
            turning once to grease the top. Refrigerate, covered, overnight.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down; shape into 40 balls (about 1-1/4 in. diameter). Melt remaining 1/2 cup butter. In a
            shallow bowl, combine cinnamon and remaining 1 cup sugar. Dip balls into butter, then roll in sugar mixture.
        </li>
        <li>For caramel, bring brown sugar, butter and cream to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook and
            stir 3 minutes. Pour half the caramel into a greased 10-in. fluted tube pan; layer with half the pecans and
            half the dough balls; repeat. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°. Bake until golden brown, 30-40 minutes. (Cover loosely with foil for last 10 minutes
            if top browns too quickly.) Cool 10 minutes before inverting onto a serving plate.</li>
        <li>For optional glaze, beat cream cheese and butter until blended; gradually beat in confectioners' sugar. Add
            enough milk to reach desired consistency. Drizzle glaze over warm bread.</li>

        <li>Place chocolate in a small bowl. In a small saucepan, bring cream just to a boil. Pour over chocolate; whisk
